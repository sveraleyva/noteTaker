This program can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.

## Experience

This was a helpful assignment in that it increased my understanding of servers, ports, and routes. Deploying the app to Heroku was also a bit of a headache, but I'm glad that I now have that experience and can do it in the future. I also made the delete route, but I wasn't able to get it to work on Heroku for some reason, even though it worked on my localhost site.

## Credits

We worked on this homework challenge as a class during office hours. I also used this website for more help with Express.js and servers: https://dev.to/aneeqakhan/how-to-setup-a-nodejs-server-port-25l6 and this one for deploying to Heroku: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-deploy-an-application-to-heroku/.
